Monitoring and tracking of key environmental variables such as tempertaure, humidity, and air quality.
This project aims to monitor key environmental metrics such as temperature, humidity, and air quality in a specified area. Its versatile framework lays the groundwork for a range of applications, from controlling indoor temperature through actuators to activating alarms when detecting dangerous levels of toxic gases.

The project unfolds in two main phases. Initially, we'll construct a web server designed to present our collected data in a JSON format. This step sets the stage for our subsequent venture into data visualization, leveraging the capabilities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render the information in an accessible and intuitive manner.

The latter phase shifts focus towards the application of our data in a practical, real-world scenario: the creation of a Twitter bot. This bot, programmed in Python and hosted on a Raspberry Pi, will serve to broadcast our environmental findings, demonstrating a novel use of the data collected.
